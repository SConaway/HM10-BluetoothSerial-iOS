# RobotControl
This is a simple iOS 9/10 app that lets you communicate with an Arduino-based Bluetooth Robot using an HM10 (or HM11 or similar) Bluetooth UART module. This way you can control your robot with just your iPhone/iPad.

The helper class for the bluetooth communication can also be found [here](https://github.com/hoiberg/SwiftBluetoothSerial).
